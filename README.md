## Content 

1. `C++` [Lists and Arrays Templates](./1_AbstractListArraysTemplate/): List implemented with arrays, abstract class, classes positions, templates, search algorithms and generic order associated with an abstract list in C++

2. `Jupyter-Python` [Cache & Memory Hierarchy](./2_CacheMemoryHierarchy/): In this project, you will find detailed information and examples about the following topics:
    - **Definition of Memory Hierarchy**: Understanding the different levels of memory in a computer system, from registers to main memory to various levels of cache.
    - **Locality**: Exploring the principles of locality, including temporal and spatial locality, and how they influence memory retrieval.
    - **Cache**: Detailed explanation of what a cache is, how to place a block in the cache, and how to identify it.

3. `C++` [Simulation of Jump Predictors](./3_JumpPredictorsSimulation/) : This project involves the simulation of jump predictors. Each of these predictors is simulated and their performance is analyzed. It includes four types of jump predictors:
    - **Bimodal**: A simple jump predictor that uses a single bit to predict the outcome of a branch.
    - **Private History**: A jump predictor that maintains a separate history for each branch instruction.
    - **Global History** (`-bp 2`): A jump predictor that uses the history of all branch instructions to predict the outcome of a branch.
    - **Tournament** (`-bp 3`): A jump predictor that uses both a global predictor and a private predictor, and chooses between them using a selector.
4. `C++ and python` [Time Complexity and Order of Growth Analysis](./4_TimeDurationComplexityAnalysis/): This repository contains implementations of various algorithms in Python and C++, with a focus on understanding their time complexity and order of growth.
5. `C++` [Stacks and Queues](./5_StacksTailsStructures/): Stacks and Queues are fundamental data structures in computer science that are used in various types of computation.
6. `C++` [Binary Search Trees (ABB) vs Red-Black Trees](./6_BinaryVsRedBlackTrees/): This project explores two types of self-balancing binary search trees: Binary Search Trees (ABB) and Red-Black Trees.
