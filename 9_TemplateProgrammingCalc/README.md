----------

> The project involves the development of a series of classes with templates that allow basic operations with integers, real numbers, fractions, and polynomials. This has been developed with operator overloading, a feature in C++ that allows certain operators to be used in a more intuitive way for user-defined types.

The main components of the project are:

- **Calculadora:** A template-based calculator class that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Fraccion:** A class that represents a fraction and allows basic arithmetic operations on fractions.
- **Polinomio:** A class that represents a polynomial and allows operations such as addition and subtraction of polynomials.
- **polinomio_divi_multi:** A class that represents a polynomial and allows multiplication and division of polynomials.
