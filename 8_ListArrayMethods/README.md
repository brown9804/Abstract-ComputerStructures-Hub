> This repository contains code related to Lists and Arrays in C++. 

## How to run

To run the program, navigate to the folder containing the program through your console or terminal. This could be either the folder containing the ordering and search methods or the folder containing the list and its possible functions in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Once you're in the correct directory, type the following command in the console or terminal:

```
$ make
```

## Troubleshooting

If the compiler fails, it may be due to certain requirements. In that case, you should type the following commands in the console or terminal. For Debian/Ubuntu users, to install necessary libraries:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

If you need to update your software:

```
$ software update --install -a

```
