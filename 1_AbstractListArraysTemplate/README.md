----------

> List implemented with arrays, abstract class, classes positions, templates, search algorithms and generic order associated with an abstract list in C++. To run the program, go to the folder through your console or terminal where the program is located, either "List" or the "Sort" or "Search" folder. You should enter and type in the console or terminal:

```
$ make
```

If the compiler fails, it may be because it has certain possible requirements, so you will need to type in the console or terminal:

- Install libraries on Debian/Ubuntu:

```
$ sudo apt-get install libncurses5-dev libncursesw5-dev
```

- Need some updates:

```
 $ softwareupdate --install -a
```
